## Overview

The redirection server is the server that hosts a bunch of URLs that redirect you to the right places. For example: `redirects.tygo.van.den.hurk.dev/github/personal` redirects you to my personal github. This has two functions:

1. I only have to change 1 link if a link brakes.
2. I can count how many people clicked on a link.
