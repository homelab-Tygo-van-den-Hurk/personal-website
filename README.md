> [!WARNING]
> I am going to rewrite this entire repository and rename it. It will contain several repositories at once namely the frontend, backend, redirection, and asset server. This is low on my priority listm but keep your eyes peeled.

# Tygo-van-den-Hurk.com
> This reposositry holds the source code for [my website (`tygo-van-den-hurk.com`)](https://tygo-van-den-hurk.com/). 

> [!WARNING]
> Though a word of warning, I am going to let this domain expire. From the third of August 2024, this domain will no longer be associated with me. Everything will be going through [`tygo.van.den.hurk.dev`](https://tygo.van.den.hurk.dev) and it's subdomains.

In this repository I stored the config files for apache, the content for apache to serve, and the docker config file. This way I could start the server in just three commands in case of a wipe, crash, or lose of any kind:
```BASH
$ git clone https://github.com/St-H123/tygo-van-den-hurk.com.git
$ cd tygo-van-den-hurk.com/
$ docker compose up --detach
```

I would be up in as little as 30 minutes. This project also allowed me to both learn [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in one project. Overal it's been a success!
